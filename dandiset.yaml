description: "Dataset from the 2023 manuscript titled **_Sizes and Shapes of Perivascular
  Spaces Surrounding Murine Pial Arteries_** by Raicevic et al. DOI: 10.21203/rs.3.rs-2587250/v1.
  \ \n\n## Overview\nThe **14 datasets** from **9 subjects** include the original
  3D two photon microscopy data from three channels which show tracer in the vessel,
  PVSs, and microspheres. Additionally, each dataset also includes the final binary
  segmentation of the PVS and vessel used to generate the model and statistics in
  the manuscript. Additional details regarding the subjects, tracer injection, image
  acquisition, and segmentation can be found in the manuscript at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9949243/.\n\n##
  Content\nFor easier navigation, below is a mapping between the NWB file names and
  the datasets referenced in the manuscript.\n1. sub-21-07-19-b-act (Mouse 6, dataset
  K)\n2. sub-21-09-01-b-act (Mouse 8, dataset M)\n3. sub-21-09-20-b-act (Mouse 9,
  dataset N)\n4. sub-21-10-08-b-act (Mouse 7, dataset L)\n5. sub-BPN-M4 (Mouse 3,
  dataset E and F)\n6. sub-BPN-M6 (Mouse 4, dataset G and H)\n7. sub-BPN-M7 (Mouse
  5, dataset I and J)\n8. sub-BPN-OLD-M2 (Mouse 1, dataset A and B)\n9. sub-BPN-OLD-M3
  (Mouse 2, dataset C and D)\n\n## Instructions for Reading the Data:\nThe .nwb files
  can be viewed using Python or MATLAB, as described at https://www.nwb.org/how-to-use/.
  For convenience, the following instructions describe the steps to open and view
  the one of the .nwb files in MATLAB.\n1. Follow the instructions to install MatNWB
